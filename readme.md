**How to run:**

1. Open the project in an IDE; We recommend IntelliJ but others should work. 
2. If necessary, open pom.xml and make update the environment so that all project dependencies are loaded. Alternatively, use the built-in tool window from your IDE.
3. Locate src/main/kotlin/Main.kt
4. Run the main function.
5. Further instructions are shown in the program.

Optional:
For processing large statements and limiting useless entailments, you may want to go into src/main/kotlin/BeliefBase.kt
and change the value of RELEVANT_ORS which is located in the very top of the document. This variable is also described in the report.
